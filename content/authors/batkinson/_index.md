I am a first year MRC University of Glasgow CVR PhD student and am rotating in the VIBE lab. For the past two years, I worked at the U.S. CDC Division of Vector-Borne Disease where I focused my research on improving viral diagnostics and sequencing protocols. My current work in the VIBE lab uses machine learning and language models to predict avian influenza re-assortment patterns based on RNA and protein interactions. I am deeply motivated to pursue research through interdisciplinary avenues including disease ecology, molecular virology, field epidemiology and One Health.

Outside of the lab, I like to weight-lift, travel across the Highlands and cook various soups. Fun fact: I play Pokemon competitively and am competing in the European International Championships 2025!
