I started a postdoctoral research position in the VIBE lab at the end of 2024 following the completion of my PhD researching viral protein evolution. My work uses machine learning to understand what factors determine viral host range and consequently the macroevolutionary events that enable cross-species disease transmission. I am also interested in how primary research in this field can contribute to public health policy and surveillance for zoonotic disease outbreaks.
