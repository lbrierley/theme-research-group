I am a Postdoctoral Research Assistant in the VIBE lab following my PhD in Epidemic Modelling Techniques at the University of New South Wales, Australia. My work focuses on focus on AI-driven prediction models, graph-based inference, and computational approaches to infectious disease prediction. My interests lie in computational biology, infectious disease dynamics, and the development of data-integrated tools to support public health response.
