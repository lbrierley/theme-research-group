I started the VIBE Research Lab in 2024 following an MRC Career Development Award to advance research in biostatistics, computer science, and virology. You can find more about our specific research programmes [here](/research), and you can find my full academic CV [here](/uploads/cv_lbrierley.pdf).

Aside from research, I contribute to teaching and am particularly passionate about shaking up the ways in which we teach statistics and data science. I'm also a [Statistical Ambassador](https://rss.org.uk/membership/faq/rss-statistical-ambassadors/) for the Royal Statistical Society, in which I aim to improve public understanding and communication of stats, risk, and the data in our everyday lives.
