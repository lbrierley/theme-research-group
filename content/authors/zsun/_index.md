I am a research associate at the University of Oxford, passionate about exploring the convergence of AI and public health. My work focuses on applying machine learning to epidemiology and zoonotic infections, leveraging AI and data science to analyse complex biological data. I bring an interdisciplinary approach, combining knowledge representation learning, natural language processing (LLMs), and bioinformatics to address infectious disease challenges. I believe in the vast potential of this AI-health synergy to transform infectious disease research and improve global health outcomes.
