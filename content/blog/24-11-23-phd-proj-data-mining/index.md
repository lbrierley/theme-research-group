title: PhD project available in pathogen data mining!

**A fully funded 4y PhD project is now open for application.** The successful candidate will build information systems to capture  host-pathogen relations from literature before using them to model evolution of pathogen traits.

<!--more-->

The project aims are to develop specialised large language models to identify, extract, and process information about fungal pathogens of insects, which we still know little about. The project will then involve evolutionary analysis using the extracted data to explore how these pathogens specialise or generalise on different hosts, which could help us control crop pests or conserve biodiversity.

Funding is available from BBSRC for four years, including opportunity for a three month professional internship. The project will be supervised jointly between the University of Glasgow and Lancaster University with supervision from **[Dr Marta Shocket](https://mshocket.github.io/)** and **[Dr Maxwell Farrell](https://farrell.glasgow.ac.uk/)**. International students are welcome to apply.

Applications are open to the scheme until 6th Jan 2025.
