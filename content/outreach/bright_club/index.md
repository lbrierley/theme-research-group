We help organise [Bright Club Glasgow](https://www.facebook.com/brightclubglasgow/), a semi-regular evening where researchers, academics, and university staff communicate their science through stand-up comedy! This happens at The Stand Comedy Club in Glasgow in front of a real public audience, which might sound scary, but Liam and the other Bright Club'ers provide training and support ahead of the night. It's a great way to develop new outreach skills and rethink how you talk about your work. And sometimes we take to the stage ourselves to talk about disease, transmission and our intimate relationship with animals..
