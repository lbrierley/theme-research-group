My first solo interactive science show was first developed for the Beltane Network’s [Cabaret of Dangerous Ideas](https://www.cabaretofdangerousideas.com/) at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival 2017 and has since transmitted to public science venues up and down the UK. 

The room is quarantined because of the discovery of a new virus and we’ll need the audience’s help as we race to understand where this virus might have come from, whether it could go global, and how we could fight to stay one step ahead.
