This solo interactive science show was first developed for the Beltane Networkâ€™s [Cabaret of Dangerous Ideas](https://www.cabaretofdangerousideas.com/) at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival 2019 and has since been performed at public science venues around the world!

In this talk I review some statistical fallacies through morbid tales from human history and use interactive games and puzzles to show how the data we encounter may not be as it first seems! The aim is to get the audience to think more critically about the swathes of numbers we now meet in our everyday life. View the promo trailer or a preview below!
